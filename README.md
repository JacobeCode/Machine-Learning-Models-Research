# Machine Learning - Models Research [Extra Trees + SVM]
## This project was created in colaboration - by Tymoteusz Macewicz and Jakub Gucik.

### Content

This repository contains research connected to Machine Learning project classes done in cooperation with Tymoteusz Macewicz. The project is divided into three parts:
- Extra Tress - done by Jakub Gucik - research, training and test of Extra Trees algorithm
- SVM - done by Tymoteusz Macewicz - research, training and test of SVMs
- report - done by both authors covering all performed tasks, experiments and results

The aim of this project was to examine two different algorithms/models in the task of audio classification - precisely classification of instruments.

### Requirements

All libraries in requirements.yml file.

With VS Code required ipykernel-extension.
